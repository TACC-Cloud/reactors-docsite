User Guide
==========

The client-side SDK is based around the ``Reactor`` class, which wraps key aspects of the current actor's execution in a single object to provide helper functions enabled by submodules ``abacoid``, ``agaveutils``, ``aliases``, ``jsonmessages``, and ``process``. This guide will detail usage of ``Reactor``, then describe functions in the submodules that are usable on their own.
